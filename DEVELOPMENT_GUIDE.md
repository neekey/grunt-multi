## Development Guide

Rules you need to follow if you are maintaining this repo.

- Never push code to Master directly
- Always use branch/Pull Request to wrap your change. Prefix your branch with `feature/`, `optimize/`, `refactor/` or `bugfix/` to make your branch names more meaningful.
- Always create a branch for the next version like `0.0.8`, and merge all the features or changes to this branch. Merge this branch to the master when all the changes you want to make for this version is finished.
- Always write test for new feature or bugfix.
